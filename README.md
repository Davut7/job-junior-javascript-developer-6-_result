## How

- Fork this repository
- Clone your fork
- Open the cloned repo in a terminal
- Run the command "bun i"
- Run the "bun test" command - all tests will fail
- Implement "collection.ts" so that as many tests as possible succeed - the more tests succeed, the more points you get. You should not change anything beyond the examples in this file as part of this assignment
- Make sure eslint doesn't show errors in the IDE
- Implement TypeScript types for "request" and "options" in "collection.ts"
- Follow the same coding style used in this code. Yes, there is no documentation. You just need to write code in the same style as the previous developer
- Click the result on your fork. It is preferable to use the "Regular Commit" style
